		How the task window works:

		TO_TaskList is the visible list that we see on our screens. When a task is
		added to this list, a copy of TO_TaskTemplate is created for that task.

		TO_TaskSteps is the list visible inside of each task containing it's steps,
		a copy of TO_TaskStepTemplate is created for each active step of the task.
